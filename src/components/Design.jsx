          O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the
          weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity has
          taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of
          spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
          charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
          souls like mine.
